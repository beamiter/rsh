# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Added a documented CLI contract with help, version, syntax-check, stdin,
  startup-file, and session options.
- Corrected Bash-style `$0`/positional arguments, exit propagation, `shift N`,
  `errexit`, and rightmost-nonzero `pipefail` behavior.
- Unified top-level execution across command strings, scripts, stdin, and the
  interactive editor.
- Rejects unterminated quotes, substitutions, and here-documents consistently,
  and propagates INT/HUP/TERM to foreground jobs with conventional statuses.
- Hardened history and session persistence with private permissions, atomic
  writes, multiline-safe history, legacy migration, and secret filtering.
- Made AI assistance explicitly opt-in and removed environment-value leakage
  from completion descriptions.
- Removed the duplicate binary module graph so the executable uses the library
  implementation directly.
- Added end-user documentation and package metadata.

## 0.1.0

- Initial experimental release with Bash-compatible execution, structured
  pipelines, an interactive editor, completion, workflows, sessions, and
  optional AI integration.
