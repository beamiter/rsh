# rsh

`rsh` is an experimental interactive shell that combines familiar Bash syntax
with typed, structured-data pipelines. It is built in Rust and includes a
multiline editor, job control, context-aware completion, session restoration,
local workflows, and optional AI-assisted command generation.

> `rsh` implements a broad and useful subset of Bash, but it is not yet a
> drop-in replacement for every Bash script. Keep `/bin/bash` as the interpreter
> for scripts that require exact Bash behavior.

## Highlights

- Bash-style commands, expansion, functions, arrays, redirections, traps, and
  foreground/background jobs.
- Structured JSON, YAML, TOML, XML, CSV, and NDJSON pipelines.
- Typed values, `let` bindings, closures, typed `def` functions, and reusable
  modules through `use`.
- Lazy streams (`range`, `from-ndjson`, `take`) and ordered parallel mapping
  with `par-each`.
- Interactive Emacs/Vi editing, fuzzy history search, Git-aware prompts,
  completions for common developer tools, bookmarks, directory frecency, and
  parameterized workflows.
- A continuous terminal with semantic command boundaries, allowing compatible
  terminals to present a Commands timeline without turning output into blocks.
- Optional OpenAI, Anthropic, or local Ollama integration. AI is disabled until
  explicitly enabled.

## Install

Build the current checkout:

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/rsh --version
```

Or install it into Cargo's binary directory:

```sh
cargo install --path .
```

The default build includes HTTP and AI-provider support. To build the shell core
without its HTTP client dependency:

```sh
cargo build --release --no-default-features
```

## Five-minute tour

Run an interactive shell:

```sh
rsh
```

Execute a command or a script:

```sh
rsh -c 'printf "hello %s\n" world'
rsh ./script.rsh one two
printf 'echo from-stdin\n' | rsh
```

Use structured data without a chain of text parsers:

```sh
rsh -c 'echo '\''[{"name":"Ada","age":36},{"name":"Lin","age":28}]'\'' \
  | from-json | where age -gt 30 | select name | to-table'
```

Files are decoded from their extension and can be converted on save:

```sh
rsh -c 'open users.json | where {|row| [ $row.active = true ]} | save active.yaml'
```

Typed functions and lazy pipelines extend the shell language:

```sh
rsh -c 'def add a:int b:int {|a,b| $a + $b}; add 3 4'
rsh -c 'range 1..1000000 | take 5 | each {|n| $n * $n} | to-json'
```

Discover the available commands from inside rsh:

```sh
help
help where
help --record where
```

## Command line

```text
rsh [OPTIONS] [SCRIPT [ARG ...]]
rsh [OPTIONS] -c COMMAND [NAME [ARG ...]]
```

Important options:

- `-c, --command COMMAND` executes a command string. As in Bash, the following
  `NAME` becomes `$0`, and later values become `$1`, `$2`, and so on.
- `-s, --stdin` reads a program from standard input.
- `-n, --noexec, --check` parses input without executing it.
- `-i, --interactive` requires an interactive terminal editor and cannot be
  combined with syntax-check mode or an explicit command, script, or stdin.
- `--norc` skips the interactive startup file.
- `--rcfile FILE` selects an explicit interactive startup file.
- `--session ID` restores and persists a named interactive terminal session.
- `--help` and `--version` report the binary's interface and version.

Startup and session options are accepted for command-line consistency but take
effect only when rsh starts its interactive editor; they do not alter `-c`,
script, stdin, or syntax-check execution.

CLI errors and syntax errors exit with status `2`. Command-not-found and
missing-script failures use `127`; commands or scripts that cannot be
executed or read use `126`.

## Startup and persistent state

Interactive shells import `~/.bashrc` by default for compatibility. Use
`--rcfile ~/.rshrc` for a native rsh startup file, or `--norc` for a clean
session. Non-interactive `-c`, script, and stdin execution do not implicitly
load interactive configuration or write interactive history.

History is stored at `~/.rsh_history`; named session snapshots live under
`~/.rsh/sessions`. New files are written with private permissions. History uses
a newline-safe JSONL format while retaining compatibility with the previous
tab-separated format. Session snapshots exclude process-specific variables and
names that look like credentials, tokens, passwords, or secrets.

## Semantic commands and execution context

rsh keeps the terminal as one continuous scrollback while exposing semantic
command boundaries to terminal emulators. A compatible terminal can build a
chronological Commands timeline, jump to the original prompt, copy a command or
its rendered output, and offer rerun actions without imposing a block-based
layout.

The integration retains the portable OSC 133 lifecycle: `A` begins a prompt,
`B` begins command input, `C` begins output, and `D` finishes the command. rsh
adds percent-encoded, size-bounded metadata to `C` and `D`: an execution ID,
the exact command when it fits the protocol limit, the working directory, exit
status, and duration. Oversized commands are explicitly marked as truncated
rather than being presented as exact. The execution ID correlates terminal
scrollback with rsh's structured context.

Query that context either inside an interactive rsh or from another process:

```sh
context list [-n N] [--session ID] [--json]
context show EXECUTION_ID [--json]
context last-failed [--json]

rsh context list [-n N] [--session ID] [--json]
rsh context show EXECUTION_ID [--json]
rsh context last-failed [--json]
```

`list` defaults to the newest 20 records and accepts a limit from 1 to 2,000.
It reports only output availability, truncation, and byte-count metadata;
`show` and `last-failed` include the captured output itself when available.

Execution context is separate from `~/.rsh_history`. Its append-only JSONL
journal defaults to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/rsh/executions.jsonl`, falling back to
`~/.local/state/rsh/executions.jsonl`. The rsh state directory is mode `0700`;
the journal and its `executions.lock` sidecar are mode `0600` and coordinated
with `flock`. At 32 MiB the journal is compacted to the newest records, with a
post-compaction limit of 24 MiB and 2,000 executions. Individual metadata and
captured-output records also have hard size limits.

The journal can contain sensitive commands, paths, and terminal output. Set
`RSH_EXECUTION_JOURNAL=0` to disable disk journaling while retaining OSC
integration for the terminal UI. Set `RSH_EXECUTION_JOURNAL_PATH` to override
the location; the value must be an absolute path, and a relative value is
rejected.

## AI, explicitly opt-in

AI integration is opt-in. Select a provider when starting rsh:

```sh
RSH_AI_PROVIDER=ollama rsh
RSH_AI_PROVIDER=openai rsh
RSH_AI_PROVIDER=anthropic rsh
```

For cloud providers, inject `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` beforehand
through your normal secret manager or protected environment configuration; do
not type secrets directly into a recorded command line. `RSH_AI_MODEL` and
`RSH_AI_BASE_URL` override provider defaults. Requests include your prompt,
OS, and current-directory path. Cloud requests do not additionally include
recent history or Git status unless
`RSH_AI_SHARE_CONTEXT=1` is set. Generated commands are suggestions: inspect
them before execution, especially when they contain destructive operations.

### Agent mode

The `agent` builtin runs a review-first agent loop on the shared
[jagent](https://github.com/beamiter/jagent) core (the same state machine as
jterm4's Shell Agent):

```sh
agent find the largest files under target and free some space
```

The model may only *propose* one command per turn. Every proposal shows a
`[y] run  [e] edit  [n] reject  [q] quit` review prompt; recognized dangerous
commands additionally require typing `RUN`. Approved commands execute through
the normal rsh parser with output teed to the terminal, and a bounded sample
plus the exit code is fed back as the next model turn's observation. Malformed
model replies fail closed and never become proposals.

Additional environment switches: `RSH_AGENT_MAX_TURNS` (default 16) bounds the
model-turn budget, and `RSH_AGENT_AUTO_APPROVE_READONLY=1` opts in to
auto-running only commands on a conservative read-only allowlist (`ls`,
`git status`, …); everything else still prompts. Git branch/dirty metadata is
attached only under the same `RSH_AI_SHARE_CONTEXT` rules as other cloud
context. Agent commands run in a forked child, so `cd`/`export` do not change
the interactive shell's state.

Local context queries never send journal data over the network. Local Ollama
may use the most recent failed execution's captured terminal output for command
repair. Cloud providers receive execution output only when
`RSH_AI_SHARE_CONTEXT=1` explicitly opts in; otherwise AI repair falls back to
the command and exit status. Review journal contents before enabling cloud
context sharing because terminal output can contain source code, paths, tokens,
or other secrets.

## Completion and workflows

Built-in completion specifications cover Git, Cargo, npm, Docker, and kubectl.
Additional JSON specs can be placed in `~/.rsh/completions/`. Local workflow
definitions live in `~/.rsh/workflows/`; press `Ctrl-G` in the editor to search
the workflow registry and fill its parameters.

## Development

The main verification commands are:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --locked
cargo test --all-features --locked
cargo test --no-default-features --locked
cargo build --release --all-features --locked
```

Benchmarks are available through `cargo bench` and the comparison scripts
`bench.sh` and `bench_nu.sh`.

## Current compatibility boundaries

- Startup-file import can transfer environment variables, aliases, and selected
  shell options, but not every arbitrary Bash function or interactive plugin.
- Some advanced Bash options and edge cases remain incomplete. Prefer an
  explicit Bash shebang for production scripts that depend on exact Bash
  parsing or `set -e` corner cases.
- Structured pipeline commands are rsh extensions and are not portable to Bash.
- HTTP and AI features are available only in builds with the `ai` Cargo feature.

Please include the smallest reproducing command, expected status, actual status,
and platform details when reporting a compatibility issue.
